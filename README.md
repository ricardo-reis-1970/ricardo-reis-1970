# Hi there üëã

I'm a Computer Science Engineer from Portugal. I started dabbling with code at age 12 and then decided to put a ring on it with a 5 years' Licenciatura degree in a great university (Universidade do Minho), followed by an MSc and another degree in Education. After a few decades of time partially wasted, I took a 1-way ‚úàÔ∏è to the United Kingdom and settled in Cambridge for half a decade. After that, life threw me on another 1-way ‚úàÔ∏è, this time to Switzerland. I'm not thinking of any more 1-ways. Switzerland is top of the World.

I worked most of my life on full stack. I have a solid past in C, a dark past in PHP5 and .NET and a great past in HTML, CSS and _vanilla_ JS, since back from the mid-90s. Among the things I've been gladly onboarding are Python, SPAs, DataViz and Functional Programming Languages. I don't like OOP, never did, never will and it's long since I ran out of time and patience to educate people, so to each their own.

## Core Skills
Programming languages:
- Python
  - `numpy` & `pandas`
  - `matplotlib` & `Seaborn`
  - `Flask`, `FastAPI`, `SQLAlchemy`
- JavaScript / Node:
  - `Express`
  - `Mongoose`
- JavaScript / front:
  - `React`
  - `Vue`
  - `d3.js`
- HTML & CSS
- Chrome extensions: this is FUN, easy and a great learning experience!
- SQL

Storage:
- SQL: SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Vertica
- NoSQL: Neo4j, MongoDB

Environments:
- Windows: VS Code, Windows Terminal (you *must* try this!)
- Linux: vim (if you're even thinking of even saying emacs or nano in my presence, watch your language!)

## Soft skills
- Autonomous, self-driven and persistent (or stubborn, your choice)
- Teamwork and cooperation advocate
- Strong communication skills, 4 languages and growing
- Good working under pressure, although not a fan
- Strong analytical skills (easier said than done)
- Strong mentoring skills
- Technical documentation: docstrings, admin guides, references

## Currently working on
I'm working on a medical device for the ophthalmological industry. Those who know me can see the irony, or destiny, as I have very strong myopia and am partially sighted.

This device has very distinct dimensions:
- electro-mechanical
- mechanical automation
- software automation
- web apps
- data analytics

The core languages / frameworks are Python and Vue.js.

## Currently learning
In service of my post, I learn most every day. Nothing special, we all do it in SW dev.

My latest areas of focus are
- Python compiling and packaging: Nuitka, cx_freeze
- REST API: FastAPI, `pydantic`
- Turning an embedded Windows into a Kiosk
- **Testing**: this is a big gap in my portfolio and one I've been steadily bridging. It's never too soon, or too late.

## Learning next
I'm planning on growing my skills in a bunch of non-OOP technologies:
- **Elixir**, **Rust**, **Haskell**: notice a trend?
- [**Elm**](https://elm-lang.org/): same trend, only up front.
- **German**: it's been too long overdue. And **yes**, German is not an OOP language.

## Could be learning next
- **DevOps**: some parts seem to be fun
- **PowerShell**: I've been resisting this, but it might not be all that bad, plus it has some interesting dark alleys and shortcuts.

## Learning never
- **Java**: see the hint on emacs? This is 100:heavy_multiplication_x: worse.
- **C++**: THIS IS **NOT** K&R C! This is ugly and I don't do ugly.
- **Networks**: genetically incompatible.
- **DBA**: sorry, I have a life.

## Open Source contribs
I'm constantly trying new libraries. Many times I stumble upon things I don't like, don't agree with or feel that are missing. I've been know to contact the authors in search for clarification. Sometimes, I end up doing minor contributions that always make me very happy.

I have a growing backlog of documentation to contrib. I love technical writing and I want to do it, but time has been quite inclement of late.

## How to reach me
The easiest way is via LinkedIn. You can also visit my [`hello-world`](https://github.com/ricardo-reis-1970/hello-world) repo and open an issue there.

### Why to reach me
I have been looking into a lot of different things, always fighting the learning fight. I might be able to help you with your questions. **Hint**: I already have a job. This is a _pro bono_ thing.

## Pronouns
Were not English this genderless language, you might have already inferred: :male_sign:

## Pet peeves
**Warning**: highly pedantic section!

### Grammar
If English is your native language and it's not simple enough for you that you must go around flaunting imbecility and illiteracy with any of the following:
- "it's" instead of "its"
- "accept" instead of "except"
- "there" instead of "their"

you might want to tread carefully. I can definitely help you with that, but I'm not exactly going to be Ghandi about it.

### 1 sentence paragraphs
If your communication skills are completely Twitterised that your attention span cannot cope with more than 160 characters at a time, I am indeed impressed that you read this far! This is a great first step. Here are a few suggestions, from a few items that Manking produced. You might have heard of them. They're called books:
- **Salman Rushdie**: anything and everything. The more, the better. "The moor's last sigh" is gold, just gold.
- **Philip Roth**: you're in for a treat. The sheer bath of crude reality, inner thought and raunchy images will blow your socks off.
- **Chuck Palahniuk**: remember the movie "Fight club"? He wrote the book, and that was only his very first of some 20. Watch out for belly punches, as even the last page might yield one.

### The spelling of `Brasil` or `Mo√ßambique` with a "z"
Where do I begin? Maybe 5 centuries ago when my country discovered those regions.

Ok, here it is: the excuse that I hear for "Bra**z**il" was that this way it sounded the same as we say it in Portuguese. Right, because if in English you're going to read "Brasil", it's not like you're reading it the exact same way.

"Mo√ßambique" is even worse! The English spelling changes the reading completely. I would accept something like "Mo**ss**ambique", because it would sound the same as the original, but the "z" is just downright stupid.
